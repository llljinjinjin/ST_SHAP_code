This folder holds the `SHAP_explain_mean.py` file for interpretable, which runs need to load the model files stored in `model/seed` with the preprocessed data in `data_input/input_4`.


In addition, the raw feature map data and SHAP map data in the **SEED(sub8, sub9)** and **DREAMER(sub1, sub18)**  are stored in folders corresponding to the dataset names, i.e., `seed` and `dreamer`.
