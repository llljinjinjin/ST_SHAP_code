This folder holds the `SHAP_explain_mean.py` file for interpretable, which runs need to load the model files stored in `model/seed` with the preprocessed data in `datainput/input_4`.


In addition, the raw feature map data and SHAP map data from the two subjects' runs in the SEED and DREAMER datasets mentioned in the paper are stored in folders corresponding to the dataset names, i.e., `seed` and `dreamer`.
